# Quarkus Application with Dynamic Tenants Support

This is a Quarkus project in Java 21 that implements dynamic tenants functionality, allowing connections to different databases. Each tenant has a separate PostgreSQL database, and migrations are managed using Flyway and Agroal libraries. Tenant registration is performed through REST requests, and to test the application, we have a car API that performs selects on the databases related to each tenant.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements installed on your machine before proceeding:

1. Java 21
2. Quarkus Framework 3.4.3
3. PostgreSQL 15
4. Flyway
5. Agroal (Connection pool management library)
6. Model Mapper
7. Lombok
8. Hibernate with Panache
9. Resteasy with Jackson
10. Virtual Threads

## Database Configuration

To use this project, you will need to have a PostgreSQL server running and configure the connection details in the `application.properties` file. Quarkus will automatically create the tenant's database when a new tenant is created.

## Installation and Execution

Follow the steps below to install and run the application:

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Willian199/sample-multitenacy
cd sample-multitenacy
```

2. Configure the database information in the `application.properties` file.

3. Run the Quarkus application:

```bash
.\mvnw.cmd quarkus:dev 
```

4. The Quarkus server will start, and migrations will be executed in a separate thread.

# Tenant Registration API

## List All Tenants

```
GET http://localhost:8080/tenantController/listAll
```

## Delete Tenant by ID

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/tenantController/delete/{id}
```

## Save New Tenant

```
POST http://localhost:8080/tenantController/save
```

The request body should contain the Tenant details in JSON format, for example:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "tenantId": "tenant1",
  "datasourceHost": "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/",
  "datasourceName": "tenant_1",
  "datasourceUsername": "user",
  "datasourcePassword": "password",
  "flagSSL": true
}
```

# Car API

## List All Cars

```
GET http://localhost:8080/carController/listAll
```

## Delete Car by ID

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/carController/delete/{id}
```

## Save New Car

```
POST http://localhost:8080/carController/save
```

The request body should contain the Car details in JSON format, for example:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "brand": "chevrolet",
  "model": "camaro",
  "year": 2022,
  "engineType": "gasoline engine",
  "transmissionType": "manual"
}
```

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to create a Quarkus application with dynamic tenants support, connecting to different databases for each tenant. Flyway library is used for managing migrations, executing migrations in a separate thread and using an efficient connection pool provides a more efficient and scalable development experience.
